<p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">
In this project, I extracted and engineered clinical data from the MIMIC-IV database using SQL in BigQuery. The goal was to replicate the patient cohort and features described in Liu et al. (2022), focused on weaning outcomes in ICU patients with sepsis.


This work bridges medical research with SQL logic and prepares the ground for machine learning classification tasks such as predicting weaning success.

## My Role

I defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, designed all queries, engineered 35+ clinical variables, and reflected on data ethics and bias. I also trained an XGBoost model to analyze the predictive power of the extracted dataset.

## Key SQL Challenges

- Aligning MIMIC-IV table schemas with clinical concepts (e.g., ventilation windows, extubation logic)
- Deriving composite outcomes like `weaning_success`
- Handling multiple joins across vitals, labs, scoring systems, and therapies

## Model Summary

I trained an XGBoost model using the resulting dataset:

- **AUROC**: ~0.71
- **Challenge**: strong class imbalance (83% class 1)
- **Insights**: importance of data preprocessing

## Ethics

Queries were executed in a secure BigQuery environment with de-identified data. I completed the CITI training to ensure ethical data handling throughout the process.
